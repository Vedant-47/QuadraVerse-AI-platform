Quadraverse AI – Accessibility Tool

Overview:
Quadraverse AI is a web-based AI-powered accessibility tool designed to improve digital inclusivity and make interactions with online content more natural, efficient, and user-friendly.
The project integrates advanced AI features into a simple, responsive, and accessible interface to assist users with hearing, visual, or mobility challenges.


The tool provides four main functions:

~ Speech-to-Text (STT): Converts spoken content into accurate transcripts for observation, live captioning, and assistance for users with hearing difficulties.

~ Summarization: Condenses long documents or transcripts into clear, concise bullet points using the Ollama LLaMA model.

~ Text-to-Speech (TTS): Reads written content aloud in natural voices, with adjustable pitch, speed, and tone.

~ Voice-Controlled Navigation: Enables hands-free interaction with the website (e.g., commands like “scroll up”, “scroll down”), creating an Alexa-style experience in the browser.

Together, these functions create a responsive and inclusive AI assistant that enhances how users read, listen, and interact with digital content.

Features:

~ Accessible Interface: Large readable fonts, responsive layouts, smooth animations, and support for screen readers.

~ Cross-Platform: Works seamlessly on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

~ Customizable Speech Output: Control voice speed, tone, and pitch.

~ AI-Powered Summarization: Saves time and simplifies complex information.

~ Hands-Free Navigation: Designed for mobility-challenged users with voice-driven controls.

~ Fast & Scalable Backend: Built with FastAPI for high performance and modular integration.
